Hey there,

I'm Jean Ure√±a from the Dominican Republic.

I wanted to share some info about the note application I've built. Inside the demo.env file, you'll find all the necessary details:

I used mysql for this project.

DEV_DB_NAME=""
DEV_DB_USER=""
DEV_DB_PASS=""
DEV_DB_PORT=""
DEV_DB_HOST=""

Just replace these placeholders with your actual database info, and you're good to go!

To run the app, simply execute npm run start outside of the backend and frontend folders. This command will execute both environments (frontend and backend) simultaneously, thanks to the use of concurrently.

The app has Register and Login components that work perfectly. Feel free to create your account and test the app. Enjoy it!

Let me know if you need any help or have any questions.

Cheers,
Jean
